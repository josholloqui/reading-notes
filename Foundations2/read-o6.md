# Node, Express, and APIs
* Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
* Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
* It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
* You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing node -v
* Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond
* In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry
* npm install -g jshint This will install the jshint package globally on your system
* npm init -y install locally
* Node.js allows us to run JavaScript on the server
* Node.js, however, is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event
* Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration
