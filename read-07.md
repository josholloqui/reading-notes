# Read 07: APIs continued
* Roy Fielding assisted in writing the first web servers in sending info across the world
* Keep in mind REST
* APIs machines talking to machines
* Request
* All the fun info about http
* HTTP this protocol Fielding and his friends created
* HTTP GET on the URL
* GET POST PUT PATCH
 
#### SuperAgent 
* SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs
* DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, POST, and PUT requests can also be used, simply change the method name
* A lot of useful info. Never would I have thought that i would actually read manuals, and even more shocking I'm actually enjoying it.
