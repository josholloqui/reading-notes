# Class-14a Reading Notes 

### Google Perfect team
* 'Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences'

* 'The paradox, of course, is that Google’s intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.'

#### Transforms
* ```div {-webkit-transform: scale(1.5);-moz-transform: scale(1.5);-o-transform: scale(1.5);transform: scale(1.5);}```
* The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.
* rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.
* scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.
* definitly reread this document

#### Transitions & Animations
* for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state.
* transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.
* good resource for animations
* definitely bookmarked

#### Examples
* code examples were fun to look at and makes me want to expirement to try to execute the same things
