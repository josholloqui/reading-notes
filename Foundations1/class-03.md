### JavaScript

#### Chapt. 4 'Decisions & Loops'
* A switch statement starts with a varible called the switch value. each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
* Its like a if...else if...else statement
* In the switch statement you have cases if the function result the switch is using matches one of the cases it runs the code the reseult matches with. if it doesn't match anything its uses the default code 
* Truthy treated like true and Falsy treated like false
* Unary operator return a result with just one operand.
* Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still return true the code block will run again. It repeats un til the condition returns false.
* types of loops: for, while, do while
* For loops if you need to run code a specific number of times.
* While loops if youdo not know how many times the code should run. 
* Do while loop is similar to while loop, but has one key diiference it will always run the statements in side the curlies at least once. 
* loop counters a for loop uses a counter as a condition.
* initialization create a varible and set it to 0
* condition the loop should continue to run until the counter reacher a specified number.
* update everytime the loop has to run the statements in the curlies add one to the counter
loops are commonly used for arrays
