# Quantity Trumps Quality 
* This reading makes sense and I can see where they're coming from. From a lot of reading that I have done myself I always read that the best way to learn when it comes to programming is to keep programming keeps doing projects and side projects. Like the article says keep building. 
* Stop theorizing 
* Write lots of software 
* Learn from your mistakes
* I also enjoy the way the author called software development a craft. Like most crafts you have to hone your craft and once again like I stated up top and what is stated in the article KEEP BUILDING. Make a schedule and stick to it!

# Clean Code
* "The folks who think that code will one day disappear are like mathematicians who
hope one day to discover a mathematics that does not have to be formal"
* "This will never happen. Not even humans, with all their intuition and creativity,
have been able to create successful systems from the vague feelings of their customers"
* Code is a language which expresses requirements. 
* When it comes to bad code it makes it harder to add and implement changes.
* Rushing, crunch, and pressure can add to the reasoning to bad code.
* LATER EQUALS NEVER
* " The only way to make the deadline—the only way to
go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times"
* Writing clean code requires discipline. It's like a sixth sense aka cleanliness.
* "Programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen
through a series of transformations until it is an elegantly coded system"
* Leave the campground(code) cleaner than you found it.

# Red, Green, Refactor
* Red — think about what you want to develop
* Green — think about how to make your tests pass
* Refactor — think about how to improve your existing implementation
* Red is the starting point. This phase the test get written. This phase is important to be able to  define ehat to implement. 
* Green is where the code gets implemented to pass the tests that were written in the red phase. 
* Refactor phase is still the green phase bu this is the chance to be able to write the code to be more efficient and 'clean'

# Cycles of TDD
* You must write a failing test before you write any production code.
* You must not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
* You must not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.
* Once again Red, Green, Refactor
* Decaminute-by-Decaminute
* Hour-by-Hour
