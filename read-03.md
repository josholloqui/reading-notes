# Responsive Web Design 

#### Shay
* With the growth in mobile Internet usage comes the question of how to build websites suitable for all users..
* Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.
* all benefit from responsive websites
* Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media
* Flexible grid
* Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles.
* mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows

#### All About Floats
* Float is a CSS positioning property
* In page layout programs, the boxes that hold the text can be told to honor the text wrap, or to ignore it
* Ignoring the text wrap will allow the words to flow right over the image like it wasn’t even there
* don't disrupt the flow of the page
* Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.
* Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float

#### Don't Overthink Grids
* vast majority of websites out there use a grid
* hardest part about grids is gutters
* bookmarked
